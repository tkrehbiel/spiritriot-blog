endgameviable-dbsync -> spirit-riot-services
endgameviable-infrastructure -> spirit-riot-infrastructure
endgameviable-tests -> spirit-riot-infrastructure


## Cosmetic

- I mean, some css?
- I like the monospace font for now
- Dark mode switch
- I like the idea of a switch between a list view and grid view when displaying lists of search results.

## Short Term

- Connect to an S3 bucket to read content.
- Pulling data from a git repo at build time doesn't really work unless I can put the files in a more permanent location, such as an S3 bucket.

## Long Term

- Comments
  - Probably/possibly a separate comments page.
  - Perhaps an api endpoint to retrieve comments for a page.
  - I'm not sure I want to display comments at the bottom of posts by default.
